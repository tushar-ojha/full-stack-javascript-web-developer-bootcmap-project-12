## About Project:


Design given:
![Design](/Design.png)


- I took around 10 hours to complete this project.
  - Wrapping elements in LOGICALLY inside div should be given importance otherwise we need to go back to HTML file and do alternation which is very irritating at some times.
  - I guess, height should not be given to any div until it is very much required. This is so because while squeezing the window, elements overflows div and layout gets distored badly.
  - Fonts also needs to be responsive. We should keep this in mind.
  - Flex doesn't solves the problem of responsiveness 100%.
  - Keep coding and thinking about the code is the only way to be better at it.
