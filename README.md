## About Project: 
  ![Technology Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Technology-HTML%20%7C%20CSS-green)
  ### This project is "assignment 12" of HTML, CSS module of [Full Stack Javascript Web Developer Bootcamp](https://ineuron.ai/course/Full-Stack-Javascript-Web-Developer) by [Hitesh Choudhary](https://www.youtube.com/c/HiteshChoudharydotcom) on [ineuron.ai](https://ineuron.ai/) platform. 
  
#### Requirement/Problem statement: 
- To convert a given design (PNG file attached at the end) into HTML, CSS code.
    - External libraries/framework shouldn't be used.
    - Responsiveness is required.

#### Learnings/experiences from building this project:
- I took around 10 hours to complete this project.
  - Wrapping elements in LOGICALLY inside div should be given importance otherwise we need to go back to HTML file and do alternation which is very irritating at some times.
  - I guess, height should not be given to any div until it is very much required. This is so because while squeezing the window, elements overflows div and layout gets distored badly.
  - Fonts also needs to be responsive. We should keep this in mind.
  - Flex doesn't solves the problem of responsiveness 100%.
  - Keep coding and thinking about the code is the only way to be better at it.
